## Practical Recommendations

### ‚úÖ Best Practices for Maximizing CLAP Scores

1. **Add contextual activity** (reading, narrating): +35% boost
2. **Include emotional/professional tone**: +26% boost
3. **Describe voice quality** (clear, calm): +20% boost
4. **Use technical gender terms** (male voice, male speaking): +14% boost
5. **Avoid incorrect gender**: -24% penalty
6. **Avoid non-speech descriptions**: -69% penalty

### üìã Recommended Description Templates

For **male speech**, use:
- **Best**: "a man reading aloud" (615.89)
- **Good**: "a male speaking professionally" (572.47)
- **Good**: "a man with a clear voice" (534.38)
- **Good**: "a male voice speaking calmly" (547.24)

For **generic speech**, use:
- "someone speaking" (466.82) over "talking" (430.72)
- Add "clearly" or "calmly" for better scores

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid:

- Overly complex descriptions ("a grown man speaking")
- Age qualifiers unless confirmed ("middle-aged")
- Incorrect gender specifications
- Non-speech terms when describing speech
